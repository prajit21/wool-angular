                    Knowledge can be defined as awareness of facts or as practical skills, and may
                    also refer to familiarity with objects or situations. Knowledge of facts, also
                    called propositional knowledge, is often defined as true belief that is distinct
                    from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide
                    agreement among philosophers that it is a form of true belief, many
                    controversies in philosophy focus on justification: whether it is needed at all,
                    how to understand it, and whether something else besides it is needed.

                    Knowledge can be produced in many different ways. The most important source is
                    perception, which refers to the usage of the five senses. Many theorists also
                    include introspection as a source of knowledge, not of external physical
                    objects, but of one's own mental states. Other sources often discussed include
                    memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According to
                    foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in the sense that they can
                    justify beliefs without depending on other mental states. This claim is rejected
                    by coherentists.
